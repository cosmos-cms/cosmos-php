# CosMoS' PHP Library
Using this library it's extremely easy to fetch and decrypt your content from **CosMoS, The Universal CMS**.
*For detailed documentation*, please go to: [cosmos-cms.com/docs](https://cosmos-cms.com/docs)

---
## Instalation
CosMoS uses Composer to require its dependencies.
```
composer require "cosmos-cms/cosmos-php"
```
---
## Setup
Your `init.php` file.
```php
&lt;?php
// Require the autoload.php file that's generated by Composer
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Use the correct namespace for CosMoS
use Cosmos\Cosmos;

// Create a new instance of the Cosmos object
$cosmos = new Cosmos();

// Setup the path to your private key
// This key was only displayed once when your Application was created
$cosmos->setPrivateKey('key.txt');

// Set your API key, which can be found in your Application Settings
$cosmos->setApiKey("9d25d2d0053b22fdfa1b4becdfdfa9a4");

// Give up the path for the folder where your cache files will be stored
$cosmos->setCachePath('cache');

// You can set a custom refresh rate in seconds, default is 1 day
$cosmos->setRefreshRate(60);
```

## Usage
```php
&lt;?php
// Require your bootstrap or init file
require 'init.php';

// Display your content
// In this case the content with API name 'welcome' is fetched from the API or cache
echo $cosmos->get('welcome');

// Display your content's title or type
echo $cosmos->get('welcome')->name();
echo $cosmos->get('welcome')->type(); // Returns either 'html' or 'plain'
```
